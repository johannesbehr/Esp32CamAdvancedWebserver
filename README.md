## üöÄ Getting Started  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Esp32CamAdvancedWebserver.git
   ```  

2. Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.  

3. Select **AI Thinker ESP32-CAM** as the target board.  

4. Configure your **WiFi credentials** in the project (or via SD card configuration, if enabled).  

5. Upload the sketch to your ESP32-CAM.  

6. Open the serial monitor to find the assigned IP address.  

7. Access the web interface in your browser:  
   ```
   http://<your-esp32-ip>/
   ```

## üì° Web Interface Overview  

- **Camera Tab** ‚Üí Live video stream & snapshots  
- **System Tab** ‚Üí Device info, reboot, firmware update  
- **Files Tab** ‚Üí Browse, upload, edit, delete SD card files (WebDAV also available)  
- **SCPI Tab** ‚Üí Send SCPI-style commands via JavaScript for GPIO/servo control
